#+title: GURAFU
* About
GURAFU (グラフ) is a plotting lib for Common Lisp.
(though it's still work in progress...)

GURAFU learnt a lot from CLIM (McCLIM) and SCIGRAPH,
though, I hop GURAFU would not be too complex.

* Work in Progress
Here are some little developing memos about GURAFU:

+ GURAFU should be device independent. It should
  support different backends.

  Although currently backend output only =opticl= is done...
+ =opticl= backend use BDF font (UNIFONT) for =draw-char!=

** Naming Conventions
+ GURAFU class slot variables should be prefixed with =%=,
  for example =%backend=, =%width=, =%height=;
+ GURAFU low-level operation methods should be postfixed
  with =!=, for example =draw-text!=, =draw-line!=;
+ GURAFU constants should be wrapped with =+=, for example
  =+white+=, =+black+=;
+ GURAFU global variables should be wrapped with =*=, for
  example =*foreground-color*=, =*background-color*=;
